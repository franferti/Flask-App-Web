# Flask-App-Web

https://elbabucha.pythonanywhere.com/

üåê Project Description
This is a simple web app built with Python and Flask just to show my knowledge using Flask. 

The app demonstrates the use of Flask for routing, basic HTML and CSS for front-end rendering, and Python logic to randomize content. 

It's hosted on PythonAnywhere and serves as a lighthearted project to showcase Flask fundamentals and deployment.
